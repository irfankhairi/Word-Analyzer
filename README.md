# Word-Analyzer

For counting how many vowels in the word, I make an array of vowels first. and the For loops to assess the word by using split() function. If-else function to distinguish vowels and consonants. If there is vowels, addVowels++. If there is consonants, addConsonants++ As for the length of the words, basically just add .length
